            <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
            <p>
                This document sets forth the Privacy Policy of CourseMaster in collecting, storing and processing Personal Data received from CourseMaster customers (“Customers”) and website visitors. For purposes of this Privacy Policy, “Personal Data” shall mean any information provided to CourseMaster that relates to an identified or identifiable individual.

                Unless otherwise stated in this Privacy Policy, this policy shall be deemed to apply to CourseMaster Incorporated and our affiliates, and all references to "we", "us" and/or "our" shall refer to CourseMaster Incorporated and those affiliates.
            </p>
            <h1>PERSONAL DATA COLLECTED</h1>

            For CourseMaster Customers:
            We may collect, process and/or store your Personal Data from a number of sources, primarily to provide products and services under our contracts with our Customers and to improve those products and services.

            Sometimes we collect data, such as name, company name, IP address and email or physical address, directly from you when you provide contact and other information to us through a CourseMaster website (a "Site"), or when you ask us a question, make a comment, request support, or use certain services. By voluntarily providing us with Personal Data, you consent to our use of that information in accordance with this Privacy Policy. If you provide Personal Data to us electronically, you acknowledge and agree that such Personal Data may be transferred from their current location to offices and servers of ours and our subcontractors located in the United States and other countries in order to provide our services to you, consistent with applicable law.

            We also may obtain Personal Data by recording how you use our products, for example through error reports or other usage data. When you visit a Site, certain Personal Data may be collected by recording how you interact with that Site via cookies or web beacons (see the “Information Collected via Cookies” and “Managing Cookies” sections below for further details). If you participate in CourseMaster online discussions about our products and services, you may opt to register as a participant and also provide us with a personal profile, a picture or other Personal Data.

            <h2>From Visitors to our website(s):</h2>
            Non-identifiable Information: When you utilize a Site, we may receive certain personally non-identifiable information about your use of the Site. We may store such information ourselves or it may be included in databases owned and maintained by us, our subcontractors, agents or our business partners. We may use such information and pool it with other information to track, for instance, the total number of visitors to a Site and the domain names of our visitors' Internet service providers.

            Information Collected via Cookies and Similar Technologies: Like most websites, we also collect and/or log specific Site visitor information, which may include both non-identifiable information and Personal Data, including what kind of browser visitors are on, what operating system they are using, their IP address, cookie information, time stamp and clickstream information. This data is collected through the use of log files, "cookies," "web beacon" or other similar technologies. "Cookies" are small files of data that may be sent to your web browser and stored on your computer. With "web beacons," when a visitor accesses certain pages on a Site, an anonymous notice of that visit is generated which may be processed by us. Web beacons work in conjunction with cookies to let us know what portions of our Sites are of interest to you and to help us provide you with tailored information from our Sites. We may collect and store this information and combine it with other Personal Data you have provided.

            We also use first-party and third-party cookies in online advertising efforts. When you visit a Site, third parties may set cookies on your computer and use those cookies to collect information about you, including about your computer and how you use the Site. These parties use such information to personalize and deliver targeted advertising to you on non-CourseMaster websites. For additional information about online behavioral advertising, visit the websites of the Network Advertising Initiative and the Digital Advertising Alliance.

            Managing Cookies and Similar Technologies:
            Most web browsers can be configured not to accept cookies, notify you if a cookie is sent to you, or otherwise manage cookies, web beacons and similar technologies. If you turn off cookies, web beacons and similar technologies will still detect anonymous visits, but the notices they generate cannot be associated with other anonymous information or personally-identifiable information and are disregarded. Similarly, if you would like to prevent third parties from setting and accessing cookies and similar technologies on your computer for advertising and other purposes, you can configure your browser to manage or block cookies and those technologies. Additionally, cookie preferences, including the ability to opt-out of first and third-party cookies, may also be set and managed using our cookie consent manager tool, where applicable.

            Social Media Features and Widgets:
            Our Sites may include social media features, such as video links, “Like” buttons, and widgets such as “Share” buttons or interactive mini-programs. These features may collect your Personal Data such as your IP address and which website page you are visiting, and may set a cookie to enable the feature to function. Social media features and widgets may be hosted by a third party or hosted directly on our Sites. Your use and interactions with these features are at your option and are governed by the published privacy policy of the companies providing them.

            Research:
            In an ongoing effort to better understand and serve all users of CourseMaster services, we may conduct research on user demographics and interests based on the Personal Data and other information provided to us. This research may be compiled and analyzed on an aggregate basis, and we may share this aggregated data with our affiliates, agents and business partners. This aggregate information does not identify you personally.

            <h2>Do Not Track:</h2>
            Like many websites, our Sites do not currently respond to "do not track" browser headers. Cookie preferences, including the ability to opt-out of first and third-party cookies, may be set and managed using our cookie consent manager tool. Additionally, you can take steps to limit tracking by erasing cookies and similar technologies from your computer's hard drive and by setting your browser to block all cookies or similar technologies or warn you before they are stored. Should you choose to remove all stored cookies, including the opt-out cookies set via our cookie consent manager tool, you may need to reestablish your cookie preferences with the tool.

            <h2>How CourseMaster Uses Personal Data:</h2>

            We use the Personal Data you provide to us in a manner that is consistent with this Privacy Policy.

            If you visit our Sites: We may use your Personal Data in the manner described in Section 1 above. You can use many features of our Sites without providing any Personal Data, however, you may not be able to use certain services.

            If you provide Personal Data to us directly in another manner: We may use your Personal Data in connection with the reason for which it was provided, such as to deliver the product or service you requested, answer the question you posed, or diagnose a technical support issue. We also may use it to send you product or service notices that may be of importance to you, prevent, detect or investigate illegal or fraudulent activity, or use it as otherwise disclosed to you when you provide the information. We may use Personal Data information to contact you in the future to tell you about services we believe will be of interest to you. When we contact you in these ways, we will do so based on your prior consent to receive such communications, or upon our “legitimate interest” to communicate with you, for instance if we have information to share based upon your prior relationship with CourseMaster. In every case, we offer you the opportunity to "opt-out" from receiving further such communications.

            If you are a CourseMaster job applicant or CourseMaster employee: We collect Personal Data from CourseMaster job applicants to conduct our applicant review and hiring activities. We collect Personal Data from our employees for the purposes of fulfilling our human resources responsibilities as described above. CourseMaster employee Personal Data may be accessed by our human resources, IT and support personnel, and their subcontractors, in the United States and other countries as reasonably required to fulfill these obligations, consistent with applicable law. CourseMaster takes reasonable steps to ensure that all job applicant and employee data collected is accurate, complete and current for its intended use.

            Our Disclosure of Your Personal Data

            CourseMaster does not sell or rent your Personal Data to third parties for promotional purposes.

            CourseMaster will not use, share or distribute your Personal Data except as follows: i) as necessary to maintain the security of our products, ii) as required by applicable law, iii) or as otherwise set forth in the subsequent paragraphs of this Section directly below.

            Business Transfers: As we develop our business, we might sell or buy businesses or assets. In the event of a sale, merger, reorganization, dissolution or similar event relating to all or a portion of our business, assets or a Site, Personal Data may be part of the transferred assets.

            Service providers, subcontractors, agents: We sometimes hire other companies to perform certain business-related functions. Examples include hosting and/or maintaining databases, mailing information on our behalf and processing payments. When we employ another party to perform a service or function, we may need to provide them with access to certain Personal Data. In that event, we only provide them with the information that they need to perform their specific service or function. CourseMaster is accountable for any Personal Data that it receives from you and subsequently transfers to these third parties, in accordance with applicable privacy law. We remain responsible if a third-party that we engage to process Personal Data on our behalf does so in a manner inconsistent with applicable law, unless we can prove that we are not responsible for the activities or circumstances giving rise to the claim.

            Partners and related third parties: We may share information with third party partners who resell our products and services and/or provide value added services. We may offer with third parties (solely or jointly) webinars, white papers, or other services related to our offerings or services. We may share your contact information and your expressed interest in these offerings or services with third parties, if you have provided prior consent to this use of your data, or if we believe we have a legitimate interest in doing so, based on our prior business relationship with you.

            <h2>Legal Requirements:</h2>
            We also may disclose your Personal Data if required to do so by law or in the good faith belief that such action is necessary to (i) comply with a legal obligation, (ii) protect and defend our rights or property, (iii) act in urgent circumstances to protect the personal safety of users of a Site or the public, or (iv) protect against legal liability.

            Finger Scan Data: For employees of Customers who use CourseMaster terminals with a biometric or finger scanning device for employee timekeeping, please see Section 10 (Biometric Data Privacy) of this Policy.

            <h2>Links to Other Websites:</h2>
            Our Sites may frame or contain references or links to other websites not owned, operated or controlled by CourseMaster, and their privacy policies may differ from ours (the "External Sites").

            We utilize commercially reasonable physical, technical, and administrative controls and procedures to safeguard the Personal Data provided to CourseMaster and protect it from loss, misuse, and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, or destruction. However, no Internet or e-mail transmission is ever fully secure or error free. In particular, e-mail sent to or from CourseMaster may not be secure.

            <h2>Opt Outs:</h2>
