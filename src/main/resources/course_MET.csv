MET,CS,775,Advanced Networking,4,IN_PERSON,"The purpose of this course is to provide a solid foundation for the networking practitioner. While CS 535 introduces the basic networking concepts, this course provides the deep understanding that the practitioner who may be developing or evaluating network products needs to know. Consequently, this course does a much 'deeper dive' into the topics that tend to be the most counter-intuitive such as naming and addressing, synchronization, congestion management and routing. Naming and addressing is the least understood topic in networking and the most important. This topic is not covered in any current textbooks. The student will explore why the necessary and sufficient condition for synchronization for reliable data transfer is to bound 3 timers and independent of message exchanges. This is not at all obvious and has deep implications for protocols. To engineer networks, it is important to understand the degree to which the behavior of error and flow control protocols can be modified and to what purposes. Congestion management is the second least understood topic in networking. The course emphasizes congestion avoidance as opposed to congestion control and explores the impact in different environments. Routing is the third least understood topic in networking. This course is most concerned with its role in resource allocation but also that 'routing protocols' are really distributed database protocols. In addition, the course will consider the interactions among these topics and the necessity of keeping the system effects in perspective. Prereq: MET CS 535; or instructor's consent.",0

Race, Ethnicity and Food -- Constructions and experiences of race and ethnicity shape and are shaped by foodways. Both positive and negative definitions of racial and ethnic identities delimit access to and use of different foodstuffs and preparations. In this class we explore these processes, focusing particularly on North America. We will read widely in the literature, paying close attention to intersectional scholarship to understand how limitations related to race, ethnicity, class, religion, gender and sexuality reinforce each other and are also challenged and resisted together. Students will be responsible for participating in and sometimes leading discussion, completing regular writing assignments and designing and completing a semester-long research project.

Sociology of Taste -- Taste has an undeniable personal immediacy: producing visceral feelings ranging from delight to disgust. As a result, in our everyday lives we tend to think about taste as purely a matter of individual preference. However, for sociologists, our tastes are not only socially meaningful, they are also socially determined, organized, and constructed. This course will introduce students to the variety of questions sociologists have asked about taste. What is a need? Where do preferences come from? What social functions might our tastes serve? Major theoretical perspectives for answering these questions will be considered, examining the influence of societal institutions, status seeking behaviors, internalized dispositions, and systems of meaning on not only what we enjoy--but what we find most revolting.",0

MET,ML,692,Evaluating and Developing Markets for Cultural Tourism,4,HYBRID,"Culinary Tourism', sometimes called 'Food Tourism' or 'Gastronomy Tourism' encompasses the active engagement with food and beverage experiences within a given culture or society, reflecting a sense of place, heritage or tradition. Most often associated with International travel focusing on food, drink and tourist economies, examples of culinary tourism are increasingly found even domestically, in one's own home city or town. The idea of exploring a place for culinary purposes (eating, drinking, cooking, learning about local and regional foods) has a long history, however today the travel industry is showing record numbers with no signs of slowing. Nearly 50% of International travelers cite food and drink as the primary purpose of their journeys and the field has never before offered so many options and of food and drink experiences to choose from.

From 'gourmet' chef-led tours and ultra-local street food crawls to home cooking classes, agricultural visits and everything in between, this course will consider both the theoretical and practical aspects of culinary tourism in the 21st century. We will focus on questions around identity (food as expression), authenticity ('going to the source'), commoditization ('who gets to cook/eat what and why?') and the role of food and travel media, as well as travel industry issues such as overtourism, environmental impact and cultural appropriation.

In addition to learning the history and concepts behind culinary tourism's development, we will also take a practical approach, looking at how the industry itself functions -- how are food and drink tours/experiences put together? Who are the industry stakeholders? What are the trends and forces driving the growing interest and what affect can this have -- both good and bad -- on local economies and cuisines?",0
